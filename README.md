### Project 1 (MTA_Project) - Exploratory Data Analysis: Identifying NYC Subway Stations With the Most Target Audience

#### Abstract
The goal of this project is to help Women Tech Women Yes (WTWY) identify the top subway stations in New York City where they can place agents to collect email addresses for their upcoming gala. I worked with NYC MTA turnstile data set and 2019 NYC Median household Income data from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. After cleaning the turnstile data, high target subway stations were identified by screening for stations with high daily activity and matching those stations to NYC zip codes with high Median household income (greater than $90,000.00). Folium was used to build an interactive map that communicates the findings.

### Project 2 - Linear Regression and Web Scraping: Predicting European Soccer League Points

#### Abstract
European soccer has set the standard accross the world in viewership, transfer fees, revenue, and fantasy sports. Clubs have been spending lots of money every year to acquire players that will boost the teams chance of securing more points over the course of a soccer season.The goal of this project is to predict the total points a team can achieve based on the primary features that contribute to the success of a soccer club. These features include goals scored, total value of a squad, and many more.

### Project 3 - Business Fundamentals for Data Practitioners: Predictive Maintenance of Simulated Aircraft Gas Turbine Engines

#### Abstract
Mechanical failure is expected of all mechanical equipment and it could have severe consequences like termination of contract due to downtime accrued. The ability to correctly predict equipment failure will help companies improve utilization of equipment parts and avoid unnecessary downtime. Predictive maintenance via machine learning is designed to help predict the probability of failure so that maintenance can be scheduled in advance and carried out only when needed. The goal of this project is to show that using historic dataset, we can find failure patterns that could be used to predict failure in the future.

### Project 4 - Machine Learning Classification - Detecting Wear on a Computer Numerically Controlled Mill Tool

#### Abstract
Advanced manufacturing and large scale production depend highly on Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machining. However, many companies are not efficient because they have a poor approach to mill tool failure management. Mill tool wear can lead to end products that will fail final Quality Check, waste of raw materials, waste of coolant materials, and can result in unnecessary financial expenses if the mill tool breaks. The goal of this project is to predict wear on a CNC milling tool so that the milling tool can be replaced before products are ruined due to poor cutting structure of the worn mill tool.
