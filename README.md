### Project 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis: Identifying NYC Subway Stations With the Most Target Audience

#### Abstract
The goal of this project is to help Women Tech Women Yes (WTWY) identify the top subway stations in New York City where they can place agents to collect email addresses for their upcoming gala. I worked with NYC MTA turnstile data set and 2019 NYC Median household Income data from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. After cleaning the turnstile data, high target subway stations were identified by screening for stations with high daily activity and matching those stations to NYC zip codes with high Median household income (greater than $90,000.00). Folium was used to build an interactive map that communicates the findings.
