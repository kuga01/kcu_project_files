# Initial Analysis of the System to Identify NYC Subway Stations With the Most Targetted Audience

Kalu Chibueze Uga

## Project Assumptions
* Our initial assumption is that WTWY is more interested in funding.
* Residents in NYC zipcodes where median household income is greater than $90,000.00 are more likely to contribute to the WTWY course if they attend the gala.
* Students can be targetted better by going directly to colleges and universities since they will not generally reside in neighborhoods where median household income is high. 
* A busy subway station is defined by the DAILY ACTIVITY which is the sum of ENTRIES and EXITS. 
* In residential areas, total daily EXITS is within (+/- 2000) of daily ENTRIES. This tells us that most of the residents use the same station for transportation to work and back. Thus, residents who could not respond while rushing to work are likely to respond when returning from work.


## Goal
The goal of this project is to look for the busiest subway stations in zipcodes where median household income is greater than $90,000.00 (Based on 2019 income statistics). 

To start analysing the subway stations, a line plot of the total daily entries for all the subway stations and the busiest subway turnstile were plotted. The 11-week line plots show that subway ridership has been increasing.

| Total Daily Entries for all 378 Subway Stations | Busiest Turnstile: PATH NEW WTC, R540, PTH22 |

## Target Audience
The figure below shows a bar chart of the busiest subways in high income zipcodes from 2/28/2021 to 5/14/2021 where total daily activity is greater than 1,500,000.

Based on our current analysis, we observed that for stations with high daily activity, 08:00 a.m. through 08:00 p.m from Monday to Friday is the best period to reach the targetted audience.
