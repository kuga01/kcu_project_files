Kalu Chibueze Uga

#### Abstract
I would like to design a model that shows a relationship between some key features of a soccer team and the total points attained per season in the major European leagues. European soccer has set the standard accross the world in viewership, transfer fees, revenue, and fantasy sports. Clubs have been spending  lots of money every year to acquire players that will boost the teams chance of securing more points over the couse of a season. Some features that contribute to a teams performance are club value, goals scored, posession, shots per game, shots on target, pass accuracy, aerial ability, and set pieces. Clubs have to spend big to acquire players who will help improve these features. 

#### Design
* The model will acquire data from the top five leagues in Europe and analyze the data over 12 seasons.

#### Data 
* The primary dataset will be gathered from [whoscored](http://whoscored.com/).
* The secondary dataset will be reliable data that shows the value of a team. No definite source at this time.
* The data set will have about ten features and at least 1000 rows of data.

#### Tools
* Pandas will be used for data acquisition, data cleansing,  and data maniputation. 
* Matplotlib, seaborn and tableau will be used for data visualization.

#### MVP Goal
The goal of the project is to show that there is a strong relationship between total points attained by a team in a season and some key stats.
